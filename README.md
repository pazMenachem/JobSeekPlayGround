# JobSeekPlayGround

**JobSeekPlayGround** is a personal learning project built to explore and practice core concepts in software development.
It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with a wide range of technologies and programming principles across both frontend and backend domains.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Created as part of my journey toward becoming a professional developer, this project aims to strengthen my understanding of:

- Algorithms and data structures
- Fullstack development (React, backend frameworks, databases)
- RESTful APIs and state management
- Design patterns and project structure
- Hands-on best practices for building real-world applications

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

This project is not focused on a single technology or feature.
Instead, it brings together various components to support a deeper, well-rounded understanding of software development through practice.
